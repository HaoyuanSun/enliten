# Open Positions

We are always looking for new group members with self-motivation and talent!

You will have the opportunity to work on power system modeling, optimization, control, and machine learning. You will join projects to explore topics that you find interesting, write technical reports and papers, and present your work at top conferences.

For all positions, previous experience in one or more of the following areas is highly desired:  
- renewable energy integration
- microgrid, distributed generation, and distribution system
- power system economics and optimization
- power system stability, control and protection
- power system reliability.

### Current open positions

We have 1 (one) PhD student opening in power system and artificial intelligence for 2021.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in pursuing a M.S. or Ph.D. degree at UT with financial support, please send a formal, complete application to UT Graduate School. Otherwise, your case will not be forwarded to EECS for departmental consideration of admission. Also, you may check our EECS department website about our EECS graduate program.

Preference of funded positions will be given to Ph.D. applicants. An earned M.S. degree at the time of enrollment is generally required for Ph.D. positions; however, outstanding candidates with B.S. degree only may be considered for direct Ph.D. enrollment. If you want to apply for a Ph.D. position, you are encouraged to email me a copy of your resume that includes a list of your in-major courses and grades, overall GPA, publication list if any, GRE score, TOEFL score (for international applicants), and names of three references. However, please don't ask me whether you will receive a financial aid in your initial emails to me. I simply cannot answer this question without a thorough evaluation of your background as well as other competitive candidates.

Also, I am accepting visiting scholars (preferrably with funding from your own government or other sources) in electric power engineering.

In your email, please use _"Graduate Applicant - Your Name"_ or _"Postdoc Applicant - Your Name"_ as the subject.

### Master projects for UTK students
If you are a Master student at UTK looking for a Master project, contact me by email or stop by my office.
